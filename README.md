# how_to_faster_rcnn
Complete description of Object Detection pipeline. The pipeline based on PyTorch. Faster R-CNN Resnet-50 is used in this example.
## Required software and hardware
To work on a local machine, you must have Python, CUDA software, PyTorch (including Torchvision) and all other necessary libraries installed. In our example Python 3.8, CUDA 10.2 and PyTorch 1.6.0 were used.

We recommend to use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) for training you can also run inference in the cloud.
In the case of local work, NVIDIA GPU is required for training and rapid inference. 8Gb GPU is required for training and at least 2 GB for inference.
